Welcome to PiperChat! A full stack app that is functionally similar to WhatsApp. I built this application because I was fascinated by webrtc and all the possibilities it provides us. It was built using React, Redux, Redux thunk, pusher-chatkit(for private and group messaging), webrtc(for peer-to-peer voice and video calls), socket.io(for signalling), node.js, and mongoDB. <a href='https://github.com/abkr08/piedpiper-backend' >Here's the link to its backend repository</a>.
